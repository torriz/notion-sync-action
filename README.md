# Notion Markdown Sync

Sync Notion pages and databases into Markdown files in your repository. Create a `.notion.txt` file with a list of Notion links in any directory to get a Markdown file in the same directory. Perfect for making it easy for agents to have relevant docs for any company that lives in Notion. No MCP setup, they just become files. 


## TODO
- [ ] Make links within exported pages link to the new md local md files and not their original notion page

## What it does

- Scans for `.notion.txt` manifest files in your repo
- Fetches the referenced Notion pages or databases
- Writes Markdown files next to each manifest
- Preserves stable `notion_id` frontmatter so renames keep history
- Can commit/PR generated changes back to the repo

## Quick start

Create a `.notion.txt` file:

```text
docs/.notion.txt
```

```text
https://www.notion.so/your-page-or-database-url
```

Add the action to your workflow:

```yaml
name: notion-sync

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**/.notion.txt'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/.notion.txt'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: batuhan/notion-sync-action@v1
        with:
          notion_token: ${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Manifest format

One `.notion.txt` file per directory. Each non-empty line is a Notion page or database URL/ID.

```text
# comments are ignored
https://www.notion.so/page-1
https://www.notion.so/database-1
```

Example:

```text
docs/.notion.txt
docs/guides/.notion.txt
docs/api/.notion.txt
```

## Output

For `docs/.notion.txt`, the action writes Markdown into `docs/`.

```text
docs/.notion.txt
docs/Getting-Started.md
docs/Getting-Started/Installation.md
docs/Getting-Started/Configuration.md
```
